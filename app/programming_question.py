# Problem Statement

# You are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters.

# A subsequence of a string is formed by deleting zero or more characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

# Write a function to generate all possible subsequences of the given string.
# 🔹 Input

# A single string S

# 1 ≤ length(S) ≤ 15

# 🔹 Output

# Print or return all possible subsequences of the string

# The empty string ("") is considered a valid subsequence
# S = "abc"
# Output:"", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"
